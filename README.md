## Git vs. GitHub
**Git** - keeps track of a timeline of "snapshots" or commits that developers have made in their file while working on the project during specific times
* Allows developers to refer back to the code that they have already written and apply additional changes or debug the code to make it functional
* Allows developers to organize different directories and files
* Runs in the Command Line 
* Git **DOES NOT** require Github 

**GitHub** - stores the code that developers have written on the local machine, the computer, into the cloud, also know as the internet or the website [Github.com](https://github.com/)
* Allows multiple developers to contribute and collaborate on files easily
* Allows developers to visually track changes that other developers made
* GitHub **REQUIRES** Git
